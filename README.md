# Docker Nginx Reverse Proxy Tutorial Example Repo

This is an example repo used for a tutorial describing how to set up a local nginx reverse proxy that serves an api and app service using Docker containers.

It demonstrates how to create an Apollo GraphQL API running in one container and a Vue.js based app running in another container that are both accessed by first going through Nginx.
